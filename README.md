## CAD to USD Pipeline Overview
This pipeline converts CAD files (STEP, IGES) into USD format, making the assets ready for use in NVIDIA Omniverse simulations. The pipeline automates the import of CAD files, processes them in Houdini, exports to USD, and integrates with Omniverse.

### Steps:
1. Import CAD file into Houdini.
2. Process geometry (cleaning, scaling, etc.).
3. Export processed geometry as USD.
4. Load USD files in Omniverse for visualization and simulation.


2. Step-by-Step Breakdown
For each step, describe what happens and what tools (Houdini, Python, Omniverse) are used. This will help clarify how the separation between Houdini scripting and Omniverse integration works.
Step 1: Import CAD File into Houdini
Explain how you import the CAD file using Houdini’s UI or Python scripting.

### Step 1: Import CAD File into Houdini
The CAD file (STEP or IGES format) is imported into Houdini. For this pipeline, you can either:
- Use Houdini's File SOP to load the CAD file directly.
- Use a Python script (if required for automation) to load the CAD file.

Example Python script for importing a CAD file in Houdini:
```python
import hou

# Load the geometry node
geo = hou.node('/obj').createNode('geo', 'CAD_import')

# Use the File SOP to load CAD data
file_node = geo.createNode('file')
file_node.parm('file').set('/path/to/your/CADfile.igs')
geo.layoutChildren()

Step 2: Process Geometry in Houdini
Describe any geometry processing done in Houdini (e.g., scaling, cleaning, making procedural adjustments).

### Step 2: Process Geometry in Houdini
Once the CAD file is imported, we apply procedural geometry operations, such as cleaning and scaling, to make the data ready for export. You can use Houdini's UI or Python for automation.

In this example, we'll use the Clean SOP and Transform SOP to clean and scale the model.

Python script for scaling geometry:
```python
# Create a Transform node to scale the CAD data
transform_node = geo.createNode('xform')
transform_node.parmTuple('scale').set((1.0, 1.0, 1.0))  # Set the scale
transform_node.setInput(0, file_node)
transform_node.layoutChildren()

Step 3: Export Geometry as USD
Detail how you export the processed geometry to USD format using Houdini's USD export options.

### Step 3: Export Processed Geometry as USD
Once the CAD file is processed, we export the geometry as a USD file using Houdini's native USD export capabilities.

You can do this manually by using the "File Cache" SOP with the USD export option, or you can script it with Python:
```python
# Create a USD ROP node to export as USD
usd_export = geo.createNode('rop_usd')
usd_export.parm('sopoutput').set('/path/to/output/file.usd')
usd_export.setInput(0, transform_node)
usd_export.render()

Step 4: Load USD into Omniverse
Show how the USD file is loaded into Omniverse and prepared for simulation or synthetic data generation.

### Step 4: Load USD into NVIDIA Omniverse
Once the USD file is created, it is loaded into NVIDIA Omniverse for visualization and simulation. This can be done using the Omniverse USD Composer or scripted via Omniverse’s Python API.

Example Python script to load a USD file into Omniverse:
```python
import omni
from pxr import Usd

# Open the stage in Omniverse
stage = Usd.Stage.Open("/path/to/output/file.usd")
omni.usd.get_context().open_stage(stage.GetRootLayer().identifier)

3. How the Systems Work Together
Clarify how Houdini and Omniverse work in separate stages but are connected by the USD file format. Mention that Houdini is used for CAD import and processing, while Omniverse is used for visualization, simulation, or synthetic data generation.

### System Integration
Houdini is used to import and process the CAD file, while Omniverse is used to visualize and simulate the USD file. The key connection between these systems is the USD file format, which enables seamless data transfer between tools.

- **Houdini**: Used for CAD file import, procedural geometry operations, and USD export.
- **Omniverse**: Used for importing USD, running simulations, and generating synthetic data.

4. Screenshots & Results
Include screenshots or a GIF of your pipeline in action. Show the CAD import in Houdini, the geometry processing, the USD export, and the final result in Omniverse.

5. Final Documentation
At the end of your README or documentation, provide clear usage instructions on how someone can run the pipeline and reproduce your results. For example:

### How to Use This Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open Houdini and load the provided Python script.
3. Import a CAD file using the script or manually.
4. Export the processed file to USD using the script.
5. Load the USD file in NVIDIA Omniverse for simulation or visualization.

Summary
Even though Python usage in Houdini and Omniverse is separate, documenting each step of the pipeline is essential to showing how the different parts of the workflow fit together. By explaining the roles of each tool, providing code snippets, and showing screenshots of the process, you can make your project easily understandable and showcase your technical skills effectively.
